To run the python script for Blender which converts blender data to Pysoy

Steps to follow for Setup:
1. Download Blender tarball from: http://www.blender.org/download/ (Note that the work was tested in Blenderv2.74.0, unless blender has drastically changed you must be able to run it on any latest Blender)
2. Extract it using either any Archive Manager or run cmd:
$tar xvjf filename.tar.bz2
3. Open Terminal, go to this folder location you just extracted, run cmd: 
$./blender
4. You will now be running Blender, you can have fun with it here.

Steps to run the script:
1. Change the Blender screen to 'Scripting' on the top tool bar.
2. In the Text Editor window, click 'open a new text block' button to the right.
3. Go to the location of the script 'blendsoy.py' in this same directory and click open text block.
4. Click 'Run Script' to convert it to PySoy code.
5. Go to Terminal from which you can view Blender Data.
6. You can retrive and modify the Pysoy code which can be found inside your Blender directory you extracted in the first step of setup.
